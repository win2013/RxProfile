Using PhpWiki 1.2 with Mac OS X / Darwin

PhpWiki works quite well and retains almost complete functionality when used with a default installation of Mac OS X 10.1 (or greater), with only a few minor exceptions as noted below. Setting up a database for the Wiki backend is probably the most difficult part of the PhpWiki installation as it will require use of the Terminal utility; therefore it is recommended that you at least have some familiarity with the unix command prompt. However, the setup is straightforward and you should be able to complete the install by following the instructions in the INSTALL document included with the PhpWiki download.

If you intend to compile the required database software or PHP module yourself you should download and install the Developer tools from Apple, which includes the necessary cc compiler, and at least temporarily activate the superuser (root) account. The steps necessary to do this are relatively more complicated and are beyond the scope of this document.

In any case you may find Project Builder to be an attractive alternative to TextEdit, especially if you are intent on heavily customizing PhpWiki, working with PHP or doing any other code development. Among other niceties it provides line numbering and syntax coloring, but don't rely on PB's text colors too much, it doesn't yet properly deal with escaped (\") quotes which are frequently called for in PHP when generating HTML code.


Database
--------
A suitable database for PhpWiki is not included with Mac OS X 10.1. If you decide to use one of the more popular (and free) database packages such as mySQL or PostgreSQL with PhpWiki, fortunately there are precompiled versions of the software available. Some distributions even come with Mac OS X installers which will significantly reduce the amount of work you will have to do in the unix environment.

The MySQL 3.23.46 binary installation works well with Mac OS X 10.1 and PhpWiki. After you install and test mySQL follow the instructions given in INSTALL.mysql to prepare a new database for use with PhpWiki.


Apache PHP Module
-----------------
The default PHP module for Apache as supplied by Apple does work with PhpWiki but is missing support for the zlib and GD libraries. Wiki will still produce a valid ZIP file when an administrator saves a ZIP dump of the database but it will not use any compression.

If you want compressed ZIP dumps you will have to install a version of PHP which does support the zlib library, or compile PHP yourself and replace the default /usr/libexec/httpd/libphp4.so (part of the Apple-supplied Apache installation).


Obtaining and Installing mySQL and libphp4.so
---------------------------------------------
Mark Liyanage has graciously provided precompiled Mac OS X versions of mySQL, an updated PHP module for Apache and some installation instructions on his web site. He has also written some tips if you want to compile these programs for yourself.

    <http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/>

Note that whether you use the built-in PHP module or another PHP module, it must be activated in Apache's httpd.conf before you can use PHP. Take a look at Mark's PHP installation instructions or read the Apache documentation for more information. 

A good place to find other distributions of mySQL or PostgreSQL which can be used with Mac OS X are listed at <http://versiontracker.com/macosx/>.


PhpWiki Configuration Notes
---------------------------
Move the phpwiki folder into the directory used by the web server. In Mac OS X 10.1 this folder will be "/Library/WebServer/Documents" (unless you previously changed it to somewhere else in the configuration file "/private/etc/httpd/httpd.conf").

Follow the generalized installation instructions described in INSTALL but with the changes below.

1. The Mac OS X Apache web server runs as user "www" and this works fine with PhpWiki so long as "Everyone" has at least read-only access in the phpwiki folder's Get Info.

If you want to perform serial dumps instead of ZIP dumps you need to set at least one directory to be accessible read-write by the http server. The easiest solution is probably to create a new folder called "dumps" inside the phpwiki folder, then give the user "www" read-write access to it in the terminal:

sudo chown www:www /System/Library/phpwiki/dumps
sudo chmod u+wrx /System/Library/phpwiki/dumps

2. A few lines need to be inserted into Apache's configuration in order to use "nice" URLs with PhpWiki such as:

    http://somehost/wiki?GoodStyle
    http://somehost/wikiadmin?PhpWikiAdministration

Open the terminal and type in the following to edit the web server configuration file (enter your administration password when prompted):

sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

Scroll down to the <IfModule mod-alias.c> section. Copy the comment line "#PhpWiki 1.2 aliases" and the six lines below it, then paste it into the mod_alias section as shown below.

<IfModule mod_alias.c>

    #
    # Note that if you include a trailing / on fakename then the server will
    # require it to be present in the URL.  So "/icons" isn't aliased in this
    # example, only "/icons/".  If the fakename is slash-terminated, then the 
    # realname must also be slash terminated, and if the fakename omits the 
    # trailing slash, the realname must also omit it.
    #
    Alias /icons/ "/usr/share/httpd/icons/"

#PhpWiki 1.2 aliases
    Alias /wikiadmin/ "/Library/WebServer/Documents/phpwiki/admin.php?"
    Alias /wikiadmin "/Library/WebServer/Documents/phpwiki/admin.php"
    Alias /wiki/images/ "/Library/WebServer/Documents/phpwiki/images/"
    Alias /wiki/images "/Library/WebServer/Documents/phpwiki/images"
    Alias /wiki/ "/Library/WebServer/Documents/phpwiki/index.php?"
    Alias /wiki "/Library/WebServer/Documents/phpwiki/index.php"


To save your changes and exit, press 'control-x', then 'y' followed by the 'return' key.

Restart the Web Sharing server from the System Preferences "Sharing" control panel or from the terminal:

sudo apachectl graceful

3. To retain your PhpWiki logs between system restarts you should specify a non-temporary directory. I recommend you use the same folder where the web-server stores it's logs. Change the following (line 73) in index.php from:

define('ACCESS_LOG', '/tmp/wiki_access_log');

to something like:

define('ACCESS_LOG', '/private/var/log/httpd/wiki_access.log');

Note that the automatic /etc/daily and weekly cron cleanup routines will not touch the Wiki log file--even if it is in the same directory as the httpd logs--it will be up to you to Trash it once in a while or write your own /etc/daily.local file to include it as part of a server log rotation.

If you have problems after all of this, try contacting the
phpwiki-talk list at phpwiki-talk@lists.sourceforge.net.
