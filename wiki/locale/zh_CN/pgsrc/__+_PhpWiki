! 数据库的ZIP文件

 __[ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?zip=snapshot]__ : 仅包含最新版本 

 __[ZIP Dump | phpwiki:?zip=all]__ : 包含所有存档的版本

这些连接将会立刻产生一个zip文件， 它包含了PhpWiki中的大多数版本。这些页面会一个个文件以MIME（RFC2045）电子邮件（RFC822）消息的格式储存，快照内容格式为application/x-phpwiki，转存格式为multipart/mixed。后者，每一个子部分（格式为application/x-phpwiki）是页面
These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain the most
recent versions of all pages in the PhpWiki. The pages are stored, one per
file, as MIME (RFC2045) e-mail (RFC822) messages, with the content type
application/x-phpwiki for the snapshot and content type multipart/mixed for
the dump. In the latter case, there is one subpart (with type
application/x-phpwiki) for each version of the
page (in chronological order). The message body contains the page text,
while the page meta-data is included as parameters in the
Content-Type: header field.

! Load / Dump Serialized Pages

Here you can load or dump pages of your Wiki into a directory of your
choice.

__Dump__

%%ADMIN-INPUT-dumpserial-Dump_serialized_pages%%

Pages will be written out as "serialized" strings of a PHP
associative array, meaning they will not be human readable. If
the directory does not exist PhpWiki will try to create one for you.
Ensure that your server has write permissions to the directory!

__Load__

%%ADMIN-INPUT-loadserial-Load_serialized_pages%%

If you have dumped a set of pages from PhpWiki, you can reload them here.
Note that pages in your database will be overwritten; thus, if you dumped
your FrontPage when you load it from this form it will overwrite the one
in your database now. If you want to be selective just delete
the pages from the directory you don't want to load.
