2001-11-15 21:53  wainstead
	
	Release 1.2.2

	pages with backslashes are not being saved to the archive due to a
	primary key violation.

2001-11-15 21:42  wainstead

	* lib/msql.php: Fixed bug where page titles with apostrophes caused
	a sql error.

2001-11-15 20:22  wainstead

	* lib/msql.php: Fixed a bug with InitBackLinkSearch. Although I
	completely rewrote it, it turned out to be just a scope issue, and
	an ampersand would probably have fixed the original code. This
	implemetation is slightly more efficient at the cost of a small
	amount of memory.

2001-11-14 20:20  dairiki

	* lib/pgsql.php: More addslashes() bugs.

2001-11-14 12:42  dairiki

	* admin/loadserial.php, lib/setupwiki.php: When loading pages from
	a directory, ignore file names starting with '.'.  (Based on SF
	patch #480195 by Carsten Klapp.)

2001-11-09 12:08  dairiki

	* locale/sv/pgsrc/: G%e4stboken, Gästboken, HurManAnv%e4nderWiki,
	HurManAnvänderWiki, L%e4ggaTillSidor, LäggaTillSidor,
	MestPopul%e4r, MestPopulär, S%f6kEfterSida, Sandl%e5dan, Sandlådan,
	Senaste%c4ndringar, SenasteÄndringar, SökEfterSida: Renamed pgsrc
	files whose filenames contained non-ascii characters.  These files
	seemed to be giving certain CVS clients (Mac OS X) gas.
	
	Note that there is nothing wrong with non-ASCII characters in
	wiki-page names --- it's just that the wiki-page name should be
	urlencode()ed for use as a file name.
	
	(See SF bug #479256.)

2001-11-09 12:08  dairiki

	* locale/sv/pgsrc/Senaste%c4ndringar: file Senaste%c4ndringar was
	initially added on branch release-1_2-branch.

2001-11-09 11:56  dairiki

	* locale/sv/pgsrc/: G%e4stboken, HurManAnv%e4nderWiki,
	L%e4ggaTillSidor, MestPopul%e4r, S%f6kEfterSida, Sandl%e5dan:
	Renamed pgsrc files whose filenames contained non-ascii characters.
	 These files seemed to be giving certain CVS clients (Mac OS X)
	gas.
	
	Note that there is nothing wrong with non-ASCII characters in
	wiki-page names --- it's just that the wiki-page name should be
	urlencode()ed for use as a file name.

2001-11-09 10:36  dairiki

	* lib/config.php: Fix SF bug #424811: putenv(LANG) fails when
	safe_mode is on.

2001-11-08 22:13  dairiki

	* INSTALL.mysql, lib/config.php: SF patch #479791 by Carsten Klapp:
	Improvements to the mysql installation documentation.

2001-11-08 18:15  dairiki

	* lib/config.php: Fix SF bug #420986: Fix PHP "Warning: Passing
	locale category name as string is deprecated...."

2001-11-08 17:39  dairiki

	* lib/config.php: Fixes based on SF patch #479769: Sse https:
	rather than http: in the autogenerated $ScriptUrl when mod_ssl is
	in use.

2001-11-08 17:20  dairiki

	* lib/stdlib.php: Applied SF patch #479753 from Carsten Klapp:
	Eliminate trailing commans in the LinkRelatedpages section at the
	bottom of each page.

2001-11-07 18:19  dairiki

	* lib/: db_filesystem.php, dbalib.php, dbmlib.php: Fix the backlink
	code which I just broke.

2001-11-07 16:42  dairiki

	* lib/: fullsearch.php, search.php: Fix SF bug #445108: Empty
	search string results in phpwiki error.

2001-11-07 15:32  dairiki

	* lib/ziplib.php: Minor fixage: preg_quote does not quote '/' by
	default.

2001-11-07 15:30  dairiki

	* lib/: db_filesystem.php, dbalib.php, dbmlib.php, fullsearch.php,
	msql.php, mssql.php, mysql.php, pgsql.php, search.php: Cleanups of
	quoting details in the searches.  This fixes, among other thing, SF
	bug #456863.
	
	Depending on the backend searches for pages and/or page names
	containing '/', '\', '%', and/or '_' all failed in some way or
	another.
	
	The fixes to lib/dbmlib.php are untested, but parallel those in
	lib/dbalib.php, so should be okay.
	
	The fixes in lib/pgsql.php, lib/msql.php, and lib/mssql.php are
	also untested.	They more or less parallel tested fixes in
	lib/mysql.php, but it would probably be good if someone could test
	them.

2001-11-07 13:58  dairiki

	* lib/: msql.php, mssql.php, pgsql.php: Fix SF bug #462168: hit
	count broken for pages with apostrophes in their names.
	
	These fixes are untested, but they are entirely analogous to
	similar fixes in mysql.php (which I have tested).  Barring typos on
	my part, I think they're unlikely to cause problems.

2001-11-07 13:54  dairiki

	* lib/mysql.php: Fix SF bug #462168: hit count broken for pages
	with apostrophes in their names.

2001-11-07 13:52  dairiki

	* lib/savepage.php: Fix yet another magic_quote_gpc bug.

2001-11-06 22:23  wainstead

	* INSTALL, lib/config.php, lib/dbalib.php: Added a new constant,
	DBM_FILE_TYPE, defaulting to 'gdbm'. It's defined in config.php and
	used in dbalib.php. INSTALL now notes the setting of this constant,
	and how a blank page can occur the first time the user tries to
	view PhpWiki.

2001-11-06 15:43  dairiki

	* lib/db_filesystem.php: Fix encoding of page names '.' and '..'. 
	Ensure RetrievePage() sets $pagehash[pagename].

2001-11-06 15:43  dairiki

	* lib/: dbalib.php, dbmlib.php: Ensure RetrievePage() sets
	$pagehash[pagename].

2001-11-06 15:41  dairiki

	* lib/display.php: Fix handling of pages with '.' and/or '_' in
	their names.

2001-11-06 15:41  dairiki

	* admin/: dumpserial.php, zip.php: Fix SF bug #478449: (encoding of
	page names like '..')

2001-11-03 22:46  dairiki

	* lib/: msql.php, pgsql.php: Fix bug reported by Roger Goun
	<roger@bcah.com>: Wrap RCS $Id$ in call to rcs_id().  (In some
	cases (admin.php) we must not emit any output until we've set some
	HTTP headers.)

2001-11-03 22:43  dairiki

	* lib/mssql.php: Add RCS $Id$.

2001-11-02 00:17  wainstead

	1.2.1 released

	* lib/mssql.php: Newer version fixes a bug in InsertPage().

2001-11-02 00:15  wainstead

	* INSTALL.mssql: Cleaned it up and added some hints.

2001-11-02 00:11  wainstead

	* lib/config.php: Added config code contributed by Andrew Pearson
	for support for MS SQL Server. Untested.

2001-11-02 00:07  wainstead

	* admin/translate_mysql.pl: file translate_mysql.pl was initially
	added on branch release-1_2-branch.

2001-11-02 00:07  wainstead

	* lib/mssql.php: file mssql.php was initially added on branch
	release-1_2-branch.

2001-11-02 00:07  wainstead

	* INSTALL.mssql: file INSTALL.mssql was initially added on branch
	release-1_2-branch.

2001-11-02 00:07  wainstead

	* INSTALL.mssql, admin/translate_mysql.pl, lib/mssql.php: Missed
	these but they will be in the 1.2.2 release. Code for Microsoft SQL
	Server.

2001-09-21 17:57  wainstead

	* lib/pgsql.php: Fixed bug: BackLinkSearchNextMatch needed the
	address of $res. It was not incrementing $res[row] so it formed an
	infinite loop and phpwiki would just time out.

2001-09-21 15:59  dairiki

	* lib/savepage.php: Patch by Gary Benson <gary@inauspicious.org>: 
	Remove empty date headers when updating RecentChanges.

2001-09-21 15:15  dairiki

	* lib/transform.php: Efficiency patch from Gary Benson
	<gary@inauspicious.org>: don't compute MostPopular list unless it's
	needed.

2001-09-17 01:02  wainstead

	* pgsrc/FrontPage: Added link in FrontPage to
	PhpWikiAdministration.

2001-08-26 23:55  wainstead

	* INSTALL.flatfile: updated my email address.

2001-08-26 13:11  wainstead

	* pgsrc/PhpWikiAdministration: Had to revert... the phpwiki:
	placeholder inserts index.phpadmin.php as a result. This is good
	enough for now.

2001-08-26 13:07  wainstead

	* pgsrc/PhpWikiAdministration: Correction... made proper link to
	admin.php.

2001-08-26 13:03  wainstead

	* pgsrc/PhpWikiAdministration: Added line pointing to (but not
	linking to) the admin.php page.

2001-08-26 12:44  wainstead

	* pgsrc/RecentChanges: Added PhpWikiAdministration to
	RecentChanges... this list should be dynamic however. For that
	matter I'd rather have a totally automated RecentChanges like
	UseMod does.

2001-08-26 12:43  wainstead

	* pgsrc/TextFormattingRules: Fixed bug in the page source; the
	"Emphasis" section was not rendering correctly.

2001-08-18 01:09  dairiki

	* UPGRADING.readme, lib/db_filesystem.php: Fix SF bug #227748.
	
	When using the flat-file back end, page names with slashes in them
	didn't work.  We fix this by urlencoding '%' '/' '\\' and ':' when
	they occur in page names.
	
	WARNING: If any pages currently in your flat-file database contain
	any of those characters in their titles, this change will make them
	invisible to PhpWiki.  You should back them up before upgrading,
	and restore them after upgrading.

2001-08-17 23:57  dairiki

	* UPGRADING.readme: file UPGRADING.readme was initially added on
	branch release-1_2-branch.

2001-08-17 23:57  dairiki

	* UPGRADING.readme, lib/mysql.php, schemas/schema.mysql,
	schemas/update.mysql.1.2.0-1.2.1: Fixed SF Bug #233898.  (MySQL
	backend insensitive to case in page names.)
	
	Note that this involves a change to the MySQL schema.  A convenient
	mysql script, schemas/update.mysql.1.2.0-1.2.1, is provided which
	can be used to update your schema in-place.

2001-08-17 23:57  dairiki

	* schemas/update.mysql.1.2.0-1.2.1: file update.mysql.1.2.0-1.2.1
	was initially added on branch release-1_2-branch.

2001-08-17 22:38  dairiki

	* lib/db_filesystem.php: Attempt to fix SF bug #413446.
	
	I think this bug was due to using PHP's file() function to slurp in
	the files (as an array of lines).  The files, being serialized
	data, consist of only one (sometimes very long) line.  I think (at
	least in some PHPs) this make the file() function unhappy.
	
	Fixed to use fread() rather than file().  Also make sure to open
	files in 'binary' mode.

2001-08-17 22:05  dairiki

	* lib/db_filesystem.php: Remove debugging output cruft which should
	never have made it to the CVS repository in the first place.

2001-08-17 21:50  dairiki

	* lib/stdlib.php: Fixed SF Bug #414789
	
	URLs like http://a.com/WikiWord were getting recognized as
	WikiWords by ExtractWikiPageLinks, therefore resulting in erroneous
	entries in the links table of those backends which have one.

2001-08-17 21:30  dairiki

	* lib/stdlib.php: Fix SF bug #418267.
	
	Deeply nested lists resulted in a "Stack bounds exceeded in
	SetHTMLOutputMode" fatal error.  Now we just clamp the nesting
	depth to 10 (eleven leading '*'s are treated as if there were only
	ten of them.)

2001-08-17 20:35  dairiki

	* DBLIB.txt, index.php, lib/backlinks.php, lib/db_filesystem.php,
	lib/dbalib.php, lib/dbmlib.php, lib/mysql.php, lib/pgsql.php,
	locale/de/templates/browse.html, locale/es/templates/browse.html,
	locale/it/templates/browse.html, locale/nl/templates/browse.html,
	locale/sv/templates/browse.html, templates/browse.html: Added real
	back-link searches.  The pgsql and msql backends are completely
	untested at this point, but they "should work".  (I.e.: they're
	probably broken now.)

2001-08-17 20:35  dairiki

	* lib/backlinks.php: file backlinks.php was initially added on
	branch release-1_2-branch.

2001-08-17 20:34  dairiki

	* lib/msql.php: Added real back-link searches.	The pgsql and msql
	backends are completely untested at this point, but they "should
	work".	(I.e.: they're probably broken now.)
	
	The msql back-link search is a bit buggy, and will not find links
	if they are split between two records ("lines") in the page store. 
	(The proper remedy for this is to implement the links table in the
	msql back end.)

2001-07-17 17:35  dairiki

	* locale/es/templates/browse.html: Fix link to BuscarPagina. 
	(Reported by Aníbal Rojas <ard@valhallaproject.com>.)
	
	Note the BuscarPagina should probably (I think) be renamed to
	BuscarPágina.  (PaginaPrincipal, as well as other pages probably
	need to have accents added as well.)

2001-06-13 20:41  dairiki

	* locale/es/pgsrc/: NotasDeLiberacion, PaginaPrincipal: Added
	missing page 'NotasDeLiberacion' containing a pointer to the
	English 'ReleaseNotes'.

2001-06-13 20:41  dairiki

	* locale/es/pgsrc/NotasDeLiberacion: file NotasDeLiberacion was
	initially added on branch release-1_2-branch.

2001-06-13 20:39  dairiki

	* locale/de/templates/browse.html, locale/it/templates/browse.html,
	locale/nl/templates/browse.html, locale/sv/templates/browse.html,
	templates/browse.html: Deleted extraneous <form> tag (which was
	only emitted in admin mode).

2001-06-13 20:38  dairiki

	* locale/es/templates/browse.html: The line-breaks in the file were
	screwed up somehow.  They're now fixed, as suggested by Aníbal
	Rojas <ard@valhallaproject.com>.
	
	Also, deleted extraneous <form> tag (which was only emitted in
	admin mode).

	* lib/config.php: Added call to setlocale().  In some PHP
	installations, it seems, gettext() will not work without it.

2001-03-06 11:48  dairiki

	* HISTORY: Updated.  All changes since 1.2.0 are now documented
	(however cryptically) in HISTORY.

2001-03-02 16:26  dairiki

	* lib/stdlib.php: Fix for invalid HTML from doubly-indented list
	elements.
	
	This: ** Item
	
	used to generate "<ul><ul><li>Item</ul></ul>" which is invalid. 
	Now we generate "<dl><dd><ul><li>Item</ul></dl>" which is valid.

2001-03-01 22:48  dairiki

	* lib/: stdlib.php, transform.php: Some fixes to clean-up generated
	HTML.  See comments made on SF Task# 26974 for details about
	problems which remain.

2001-02-28 20:48  dairiki

	KonvertiereLeerzeichenZuTabs, MeistBesucht, PhpWiki, SandKiste,
	SeiteFinden, SeitenErzeugen, StartSeite, TextFormatierungsRegeln,
	WieManWikiBenutzt, WikiTechnik, WikiWikiWeb: SF Patch #404963:
	Updated German pgsrc by Jörg Rathlev
	<jrathlev@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	I've done some work to complete the german translation of the files
	in locale/de/pgsrc/. I've also slightly modified some of the
	already translated german pages.
	
	The only pages I've not (yet) translated are GuterStil (english
	GoodStyle - hard to do since it's only a quotation),
	PhpWikiAdministration and WabiSabi. All other pages are included in
	the attached zip archive.
	
	Joerg

2001-02-27 18:16  dairiki

	* lib/editpage.php: Fix SF bug #404646.  Must quote
	htmlspecialchars in <textarea>.

2001-02-15 16:25  dairiki

	* lib/editpage.php: When creating the default contents for
	non-existant pages, put [brackets] around page names which aren't
	BumpyWords.

2001-02-15 14:28  dairiki

	* templates/editpage.html: Arguments to <input> tag should not be
	urlencoded().

2001-02-14 01:32  dairiki

	* admin/: dumpserial.php, loadserial.php: Added extra paranoid
	security checks.
	
	Without these checks, if the admin directory is not protected (e.g.
	via .htaccess) then loadserial.php and dumpserial.php can be run
	directly and used to probe for and create directories on the http
	server.

2001-02-10 00:26  dairiki

	* lib/: diff.php, ziplib.php: Fixes for PHP4 E_NOTICE warnings

	pgsrc/AddingPages, pgsrc/HowToUseWiki, pgsrc/PhpWikiAdministration,
	pgsrc/TextFormattingRules: Propagate bug fixes from MAIN CVS branch
	into the stable release branch.
	
	I have not added Arno's new transform.php code.  Should we?  (Is it
	functionally equivalent to the old code?)

2001-02-01 22:51  wainstead

	* pgsrc/RecentVisitors: Corrected Ari's name.

2001-02-01 22:23  wainstead

	bug list on Sourceforge.

2001-02-01 21:55  wainstead

	dated.

2001-01-31 23:34  wainstead

	* INSTALL.flatfile: Minor addition of info, and a note on the
	stability and features in the flat file version.

2001-01-31 23:24  wainstead

	* lib/msql.php: Commented out the GetAllWikiPageNames and
	SetAllWikiPageNames functions. They don't work yet... and as long
	as they are defined, the lists of related pages appear at the
	bottom of all pages but have no values in them.

2001-01-31 23:12  wainstead

	* INSTALL.mSQL: Updated the opening statement (mSQL support isn't
	very new anymore ;-) and explained why there are missing features
	vs. the other database implementations.

2001-01-31 21:50  wainstead

	* INSTALL: Removed the notice that PhpWiki did not work with 4.0.4
	out of the box.

	* locale/translate.sh: added Swedish translation by Jon Åslund

2001-01-30 22:11  wainstead

	* lib/dbmlib.php: Going back to version 1.5, this time with the
	signature Jan Hidder used for InsertPage() that I removed, thus
	causing a bug. It feels slower now though.

2001-01-30 21:18  wainstead

	* lib/config.php: Fixed a bug in the loading of dbmlib.php; if the
	$whichdatabase was set to 'dbm' a logic error always set it to
	'dba', which had unpredictable results with PHP3.

2001-01-30 21:01  wainstead

	* lib/dbalib.php: Fixed some white space. No code changes.

2001-01-24 13:36  ahollosi

	* INSTALL.mysql: added hint about loading mysql php-module
	(suggested by Jerritt)

2001-01-21 06:00  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: corrected if-clause for 'dba' and 'default'
	(pointed out by kc7dx)

2001-01-20 16:52  wainstead

	* lib/config.php: Added a new database configuration selection,
	'default'. There is an if/else that determines whether the user is
	running PHP3 or PHP4 and sets $WhichDatabase to either 'dbm' or
	'dba', and then the corresponding library file (dbmlib.php or
	dbalib.php) is loaded.

2001-01-19 17:47  wainstead

	* INSTALL: Added note at the top for users of PHP 4.0.4 or later
	about needing to edit config.php first.

2001-01-19 17:38  wainstead

	* CREDITS: Updated the credits for Joel and Pablo

2001-01-19 17:28  wainstead

	* images/wikibase.png: Pablo Roca Rozas <proca@clavo.net>
	contributed a good 50x50 black and white logo.

2001-01-19 17:20  wainstead

	* lib/: config.php, dbalib.php: Joel Uckelman
	<uckelman@iastate.edu> contributed code changes including a new
	database library file 'dbalib.php' that uses the new interface
	library for DBM files. The changes in config.php still default to
	the dbmlib.php library for now, and the user must set 'dba' in
	config.php if they are using PHP 4.0.4 or later. Tested this (just
	barely) on a newly built PHP 4.0.4p1 on my RH6.2 box.

2001-01-15 07:32  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: ExtractWikiPageLinks now recognizes references of
	the form [\d+]

2001-01-11 04:54  ahollosi

	* locale/README: initial commit - text by Jan Nieuwenhuizen and me

2001-01-09 14:02  wainstead

	* lib/dbmlib.php: Reverted to version 1.4; there is a bug in Jan
	Hidders' patch for dbmlib.  It causes a stack overflow in
	stdlib.php line 318.

2001-01-09 13:22  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: added description to GeneratePage()

2001-01-06 14:30  wainstead

	* INSTALL.flatfile: Installation directions for flat file Wikis.

2001-01-04 13:37  ahollosi

	* lib/mysql.php: yet another E_NOTICED fixed and some comments
	added.

2001-01-04 13:34  ahollosi

	* lib/transform.php: ZERO/SINGLE_DEPTH renamed into
	ZERO/NESTED_LEVEL empty lines are now treated as tag '' (i.e. no
	tag) instead of '<p>' normal text is now treated as '<p>' instead
	of tag '' added and corrected some comments, some code cleanup

2001-01-04 13:32  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: ZERO/SINGLE_DEPTH renamed into ZERO/NESTED_LEVEL

2001-01-04 13:32  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: moved UpdateRecentChanges() to savepage.php
	ZERO/SINGLE_DEPTH renamed into ZERO/NESTED_LEVEL added and
	corrected some comments, some code cleanup

2001-01-04 13:30  ahollosi

	* lib/savepage.php: moved UpdateRecentChanges() to savepage.php

2001-01-01 19:10  wainstead

	* lib/search.php: There were two concatenation operators in a row,
	on lines 8 and 9. This caused a syntax error.

2001-01-01 18:34  ahollosi

	* lib/: mysql.php, stdlib.php: squashed some E_NOTICE messages
	about unset variables

2001-01-01 18:18  ahollosi

	* lib/db_filesystem.php: changed two more calls to is_dir() and
	is_file() to file_exists in order to avoid warnings

2001-01-01 18:13  ahollosi

	* lib/: db_filesystem.php, editpage.php, ziplib.php: cleaned up
	some warnings reported by David LeBlanc

2000-12-30 16:48  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: ParseAndLink() didn't handle unnamed phpwiki:
	links correctly - fixed.

2000-12-30 16:42  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: cleaned up ParseAndLink() function, consequences:
	- link['type']='unknwon' no longer exists (never happened anyway) -
	link['type']='wiki' is now link['type']='wiki-simple' - "phpwiki:"
	may appear in unnamed links as well - LinkURL() function now takes
	second argument

2000-12-30 16:09  ahollosi

	* lib/: config.php, display.php, fullsearch.php, search.php: some
	code cleanup -- mostly cosmetic changes

2000-12-22 16:10  ahollosi

	* CREDITS: added Antti Kaihola and Jan Hidders

	nl/LC_MESSAGES/phpwiki.php, po/de.po, po/es.po, po/nl.po,
	po/phpwiki.pot: ran translate.sh to update .mo & .php files

2000-12-14 22:11  wainstead

	* lib/dbmlib.php: Initial commit of Jan Hidders' changes to
	dbmlib.php. He added the code needed for the incoming/outgoing/most
	popular nearby features. The only change I made was to revert the
	signature for InsertPage, which he added a fourth parameter to. In
	fact it should have a (shudder) global variable $WikiPageStore,
	which makes it consistent with SaveCopyToArchive.

2000-12-12 17:06  wainstead

	* lib/dbmlib.php: Brought the function list in the lead comment box
	up to date.

2000-12-12 16:53  wainstead

	* DBLIB.txt: Updated against the mysql.php file. This should be
	accurate and finished for 1.2.

2000-12-12 16:24  wainstead

	* README: Added a paragraph about the feature differences between
	the different database implementations.

2000-12-12 16:09  wainstead

	* images/wikibase.png: New 50x50 logo in reverse color (white on
	dark gray).

2000-12-12 12:11  wainstead

	* README: Brought the manifest up to date. Some files were removed,
	others added to the lists of files in the distribution.

2000-12-11 09:00  ahollosi

	* locale/po/nl.po: update to Dutch translation by Jan Nieuwenhuizen

2000-12-06 18:12  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: fixed bug in _iftoken() -
	variable-in-string-brackets were used in a way that causes problems
	for PHP3. Fix by Jan Hidders.

2000-12-06 05:59  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: fixed another bug in ExtractWikiPageLinks():
	wiki_unknown-named was not recognized and named wiki links had the
	wrong linktext inserted into the wikilinks table

2000-11-24 17:07  wainstead

	* lib/mysql.php: 
	Added semicolon on line 153, which caused the file to not compile
	correctly.  .

2000-11-22 17:17  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: fix newline bug in UpdateRecentChanges / fix
	for-loop boundary

2000-11-18 08:50  ahollosi

	* pgsrc/FindPage, lib/fullsearch.php, lib/mysql.php: more
	sophisticated search: match individual words, also excluding words
	possible

2000-11-16 22:04  wainstead

	* CREDITS: Added Scott to the credits for patches.

2000-11-16 22:01  wainstead

	* lib/config.php: Patch from "Scott R. Anderson" <sra@diem.net>
	which allows the use of $PHP_AUTH_USER if it's set; i.e. if a user
	is logged in their name will appear in RecentChanges instead of
	REMOTE_HOST or REMOTE_ADDR.

2000-11-16 03:52  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: fix for ExtractWikiPageLinks(): didn't care for
	'[[' escapes and thus detected invalid links

2000-11-13 16:52  ahollosi

	* locale/de/templates/browse.html: corrected title link

2000-11-13 09:54  ahollosi

	table names

2000-11-01 23:34  wainstead

	* schemas/schema.psql: Added "drop table wikiscore;"

2000-11-01 23:23  wainstead

	* lib/pgsql.php: Incoming, outgoing, and most popular top 5's
	appear to work now.

2000-11-01 23:06  wainstead

	* schemas/schema.psql: Added the wikiscore table; stripped out the
	grant statements that gave me access to all postgresql databases
	worldwide ;-)

2000-11-01 23:03  wainstead

	* pgsrc/TextFormattingRules: Corrected the URL to the example
	image.

2000-11-01 22:05  wainstead

	* lib/pgsql.php: Fixed typo: "port" was spelled "pport". Probably
	from the last patch.

2000-11-01 06:31  ahollosi

	* index.php, lib/dbmlib.php, lib/diff.php, lib/display.php,
	lib/editpage.php, lib/pageinfo.php, lib/savepage.php,
	lib/stdlib.php: fixed E_NOTICE warnings

2000-11-01 05:24  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: use $SCRIPT_NAME instead of $REQUEST_URI removed
	$ServerAddress - not used anywhere (simplifies $ScriptUrl="" case)
	added ALT tag to logo image

2000-10-31 15:24  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: restructured config.php completely -- hope this
	is more readable / useable

2000-10-31 14:24  ahollosi

	* lib/transform.php: added "!" syntax for URLs as well, i.e.
	!http://some.site/ does NOT create a hyperlink

2000-10-31 14:23  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: "phpwiki:" protocol patch -- omitted stdlib.php
	in previous commit - *sigh*

2000-10-31 12:07  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: added "phpwiki:" protocol within named links
	[name|uri] UpdateRecentChanges() uses "phpwiki:" instead of raw url
	now

2000-10-31 11:18  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: Changed $WikiNameRegexp: doesn't use "\b"
	(word-boundary) anymore.  Necessary because '_' is interpreted as
	word-character too and thus e.g. "__WikiName__" is not recognized
	as link. Note that now "previously_not_a_WikiName" renders the
	"WikiName" part as link now too.

2000-10-30 02:41  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: fix for bug #117729 (fake author)

	locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/phpwiki.mo,
	locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/phpwiki.php,
	locale/nl/templates/editpage.html, locale/po/nl.po,
	locale/po/phpwiki.pot: another gettext() patch from Jan (fix plus
	translation of savepage)

2000-10-26 07:34  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: fix: added "global $WikiNameRegexp" in
	ExtractWikiPageLinks()

2000-10-25 10:48  ahollosi

	* lib/stdlib.php: adapted to changes in transform.php Inline images
	now have an ALT tag Also, [name|http:image] uses name as ALT tag
	now RenderQuickSearch() and RenderFullSearch() create a submit
	button

2000-10-25 10:45  ahollosi

	* lib/transform.php: Heavy modification based on Neil Brown's
	tokenize() patch.  Much cleaner structure now -- why didn't we see
	the obvious? Images of reference links [\d+] are inlined too now

2000-10-25 10:41  ahollosi

	* lib/config.php: added $InlineImages and $WikiNameRegexp

2000-10-25 05:58  ahollosi

	examples to TestPage

2000-10-24 05:55  ahollosi

	* lib/pageinfo.php, locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/phpwiki.mo,
	locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/phpwiki.php, locale/po/nl.po,
	locale/po/phpwiki.pot: Jan added some gettext() for pageinfo.php

2000-10-23 16:55  ahollosi

	* pgsrc/ReleaseNotes: corrected h1,h2,h3 markup example

2000-10-23 12:52  ahollosi

	* lib/transform.php, pgsrc/TestPage: New: tabless definition lists
	(even nested):	 ;Term:definition And: ul,ol list types can be
	mixed - we only look at the last character. Changes e.g. from
	"**#*" to "###*" go unnoticed.	and wouldn't make a difference to
	the HTML layout anyway.

2000-10-23 08:53  wainstead

	* pgsrc/TextFormattingRules: Updated rules for the 1.1.8 release.

2000-10-22 20:58  wainstead

	by Jan

2000-10-22 15:33  ahollosi

	* lib/: config.php, setupwiki.php: Some generic pages are included
	in English, ignoring the language setting (avoids unnecessary
	duplication) - these pages are: TestPage, SteveWainstead,
	ReleaseNotes. Removed "nl" counterparts.

	not what people come to the page to see.

2000-08-28 22:42  aredridel

	* admin/: wiki_dumpHTML.php, wiki_port1_0.php,

2000-07-11 00:01  wainstead

	* pgsrc/TestPage: This will test all the markup rules eventually.

2000-07-05 10:45  ahollosi

	* admin/wiki_port1_0.php: implemented conversion function

2000-07-05 00:48  wainstead

	* admin/wiki_port1_0.php: First attempt at porting 1.0 to 1.1; this
	just opens a 1.0 database and writes out the data to the browser.
	It's educational because I didn't think about how references are
	going to be converted from individual elements into a single array;
	I'll have to use a regexp on the key, extract the number, and add
	it to an array. I'll have to test for every key for existence as
	well... some of the pages only have two keys! The 'date' field may
	simply be lost, unless I feel like converting a date like December
	22, 1999 to Unix time. Doable, perhaps valuable to the user, but
	time consuming to code.

2000-07-03 22:11  wainstead

	* pgsrc/RecentChanges: I got tired of seeing the line about the
	birthday.

2000-07-03 15:36  wainstead

	for this functionality.

2000-07-02 23:50  wainstead

	* admin/shrinkdbm.pl: This is a Perl script that copies one DB file
	to another, and thus reduces the size by a lot.

2000-07-02 17:27  wainstead

	* CREDITS: New CREDITS file so everybody gets credit for what they
	did, in classic GNU fashion.

2000-06-30 13:51  ahollosi

	* templates/: browse.html, editlinks.html, editpage.html,
	message.html: added <!DOCTYPE> and ALT tag for logo so that phpwiki
	becomes fully HTML compliant, also added <meta http-equiv>

2000-06-29 21:57  wainstead

	* templates/: browse.html, editlinks.html, editpage.html,
	message.html: Applied a patch that adds ###LOGO### to the
	templating system. The value of $logo is now used instead of the
	logo being hard coded.

2000-06-29 20:44  wainstead

	* DBLIB.txt: Documented the four new functions IncreaseHitCount,
	GetHitCount, InitMostPopular, and MostPopularNextMatch.

2000-06-29 10:43  ahollosi

	(%%Mostpopular%% markup) quick hack - works only with mySQL so far

	* pgsrc/: FindPage, RecentChanges: changed markup for search boxes
	to %%Search%%, %%Fullsearch%%

2000-06-26 16:05  ahollosi

	* pgsrc/RecentChanges: fixed date check in UpdateRecentChanges

2000-06-25 23:56  wainstead

2000-06-25 15:40  wainstead

	thing
