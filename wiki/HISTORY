1.1.6b 06/27/00: The wrong wiki_config.php3 file was included in 1.1.6, 
and this release corrects that; also in my hurry, I included all the CVS
directories and files, and a test file. That stuff was left out.

1.1.6 06/26/00: Added templates, Postgresql support, mSQL support, new
database schema, new date storage format, an "info" link on all pages,
and introduced some new bugs (RecentChanges is broken ;-)

1.1.5 06/08/00: Here are the comments from the CVS logs:

fixed magic_quotes_gpc=1 bug for $pagename
fixed raw-HTML exploit for $pagename
fixed javascript: links exploit
Concurrent editing of pages is detected now - fixes LostUpdateProblem
(note: EditLinks is *not* treated this way yet)
search term is now preg_quote()'ed instead of chars removed
bugfix: UpdateRecentChanges didn't link names of new-style pages.
Fixed FindPage and search boxes
Added headings (!,!!,!!!), suppression of wiki linking (!WikiName), and linebreaks (%%%)
changed mySQL schema: column 'data' renamed 'hash' because 'dada' is a
reserved word. (update your tables!)

This release should work fine with the new linking scheme, but then
again, hey, it's beta!

1.1.4 05/11/00: I added the new linking
scheme, which largely follows the scheme of Wikic
(http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/RefactoringBrowser/Wiki+Syntax). Both "classic
Wiki" linking and the new linking are supported; you can now also link
things by using square brackets, like this:

[this is a page link]
[this is an external link | http://wcsb.org/]
[ftp://ftp.redhat.com/]

Reference links are still supported.

1.1.3 04/22/00: I rewrote UpdateRecentChanges completely; it's more
efficient now because it only loops over the lines once, and entries are
now newest-first instead of oldest-first.

1.1.2 04/20/00: I finally solved the problem once and for all (I hope!)
with loading pages into a brand new wiki. Vim allows you to change the
file formats so I wrote a two line ex script to convert all the pages to
dos format. (This gives them the CR/NL, unlike Un*x).

1.1.1 04/15/00: I changed the way Wiki markup is converted and 
displayed. Before pages were rendered line by line; now it accumulates
all the HTML in a variable and does one "echo" to display the page. 
While this might be a bit slower (it will use a little bit more memory)
this means PhpWiki can be modified so the HTML can be written to a file.
a whole PhpWiki site might either be served as static HTML, or
periodically exported to disk after a period of activity. This is the
secod beta (more or less) of the 1.1 release.

1.1.0 04/10/00: Support for MySQL added. Thanks to Arno Hollosi for 
his excellent work! He also provided patches to clean up the wiki_setup
procedure and fix rendering bugs with italics and bold text, amongst
others. Alister <alister@minotaur.nu> provided patches for arbitrary
numbers of reference links, fixing a rotten logic error on my part.
Removed "static" declarations to help the PHP4 porters.

1.03 03/21/00: Refactored index.php3 and wiki_display.php3, which 
had dbm function calls in them. Thanks to Christian Lindig
<lindig@gaertner.de> for pointing this out. This should make it
a little easier to port to a different database.

1.02 02/02/00: Disabled embedded HTML, due to security holes 
described in this CERT advisory: http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html
You can re-enable it by removing the comment tags in wiki_display.php3.
Please be certain of what you are doing if you allow this!

1.01 02/01/11: Fixed bug where header rules (<hr>) were inserted
whenever four or more dashes occured; this only works if it starts the
line now. Thanks to Gerry Barksdale.

1.00 01/25/00: Changed the names of all files except index.php3; I
prefaced them all with "wiki_" to avoid collisions with other files 
that might be in the include path. Thanks to Grant Morgan for the 
suggestion. A few corrections to the default pages; I think the 
small rendering problems are due to Unix's lack of a carriage 
return.

0.99 01/20/00: Added a logic change suggested by Clifford Adams, 
where a copy is saved to the archive if the previous author was 
different. A different person that is. Fixed a rendering bug. This was
breaking: http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki followed by
http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?PhpWiki on the same line. Because PHP only
can do *global* search and replace, the second URL was incompletely
swapped and linked. Using rsort() on the array of matches worked.
Added a patch from Grant Morgan for servers with magic_quotes_gpc set.

0.98 01/18/00: Added code to build the $ServerAddress dyanamically. Now,
PhpWiki will work as soon as it's untarred. No configuration should be
necessary.

0.97 01/16/00: Added a feature suggested by Clifford Adams. It stores
the author's remote address and disables the EditCopy the next time they
edit a page. Added <DL><DT><DD> support and debugged it. A new Wiki will
load a set of new pages, so the Wiki is ready to go out of the box.

0.96 01/15/00: Added EditCopy. This uses a second DBM file and could use
some more pounding. I also found a bug when two URL's appear on the same
line, like:
http://foo.com/ http://foo.com/WikiWikiWeb
In this case the second URL will not be linked correctly due to PHP's
replace-all-or-nothing regular expression functions.

0.95 01/04/00: Severe reworking of the list code (UL amd OL tags). I
added a stack class and "implemented recursion," which seemed the
logical way to accomplish nested tags. There are a couple of minor bugs
to work out, and I have to get DL tags working. I changed some constants
to define()'s instead. There are magic numbers in stdlib.php3 that
probably should be defined. I also used while() loops while doing
push/pop operations which also gives me the willies, but I put in bounds
checking.

0.94: 12/22/99 Mostly code cleanups; added code for waiting on the dbm
file if not available; added more comments. 

0.93: 12/21/99 Added full text search. Moved configuration code to a new
file, config.php3. Fixed another bug in RecentChanges. Page titles now
link to full search, which is a bit more useful. Added code to create a
new RecentChanges if none existed.

0.92: 12/20/99 Added REMOTE_HOST to RecentChanges edits; fixed a bug
where I typed in PUT instead of POST in editpage.php3; patched
RecentChanges so hopefully the lines won't get screwed up anymore.

0.91: 12/20/99 Fixed bug that occurred when creating new pages.

0.90: 12/19/99 Added user-defined links (i.e. [1], [2] etc) and embedded
images. This is the first beta release. Only an issue with second-level
lists remains, and a couple of other minor things.

0.81: 12/19/99 Fixed another wiki word linking issue. It arose from
having similar patterns in words in the same line.

0.80: 12/18/99 I'm bumping up the version to .8 because it's that close.
I finally solved the crucial linking problem, by reinventing how
classic Wiki does it ;-) URL's are first replaced with tokens, then Wiki
words are linked, then linked URL's are put back. I improved the code a
great deal for the differnet "modes" of display text; I have a function
maintain the mode, and whether end tags are needed or not.

0.07: 12/18/99 Fixed minor bug in preformatted/bulleted code output; fixed
reverse linking of page titles

0.06: 12/15/99: Added ChangeSpacesToTabs

0.05: 12/14/99: Added title searches, RecentChanges, fixed numerous bugs like
only trying to render valid page names, the last-edited-date, removed
the navigation toolbars, linked the new logo to FrontPage, and a half
dozen other odd things. It's almost ready.

0.04: 12/12/99: Several additions to markup:
   italics 
   bold
   preformatted text
   unordered lists (one level only, tow levels breaks)

In addition, wiki links have been further debugged, but I still
haven't solved the problem with wiki-links inside URLs.
   
0.03: 12/4/99: Pages are now serialized arrays instead of text blobs. Some
markup rules have been implemented. HTML is escaped; Wiki linking works
but
undefined pages do not have the question mark after them (they look like
a regular link to a Wiki page.) URL's hyperlink and should accept most
legal
URL's.

0.02: 12/3/99: Basic page editing/saving/displaying is now working.

Prior to 0.02, there were no numbered releases, and in fact there
was only one release, so I guess that would be 0.01 :-)
